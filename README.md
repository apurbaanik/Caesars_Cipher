# Caesars_Cipher
This C++ program takes a cipher text and returns a plain text. Since it doesn't have the shift number it uses "brute force" to get all the plain text possible and the one contains "Yanks" is the correct shift key. Then it uses the shift key to get the plain text for each cipher text.
